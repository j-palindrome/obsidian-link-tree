Link Tree presents a view of the current note's links and backlinks in a recursively expandable list, similar to outliners like WorkFlowy or Dynalist.

# Features
- Click on the bullet point to expand or collapse a node, showing/hiding its forward and backlinks (circular links are filtered out of the hierarchy).
- Toggle showing forward and back links by clicking the arrow buttons in the top-right
- Filter results by pathname by typing in the search box
- Click the dots button to show note content: a single line of text, full text, or nothing (text is editable and lines will save to the note)

# Note
- This plugin requires the Dataview plugin to function, as it uses the Dataview API to extract links and backlinks. Please install it before using this plugin.

# Credit
- Many thanks to Dataview for making it easy and synchronous to parse links and backlinks!
- This plugin uses libraries including React, react-transition, react-contenteditable, and Tailwind CSS.
- WorkFlowy's design inspired the look for the plugin.

If you appreciate this plugin, I would love your support for further development!
